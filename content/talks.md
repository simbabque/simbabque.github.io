Here's a selection of recordings of talks I've given at various conferences and tech meetups. I'm a regular at the [German Perl Workshop](https://www.perl-workshop.de/), the [London Perl Workshop](https://londonperlworkshop.org), and [London.pm's tech meetups](http://london.pm.org/history/).

* [Recording Talks without a camera](https://youtu.be/3kqhOvc2DuA?t=955) &ndash; At the German Perl Workshop in 2019 we only had one camera, but there were two tracks.

* [Turning humans into developers with Perl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeqTgVErzuY) &ndash; In this talk I explain my methodology for teaching apprentice software developers. I mainly use Perl, and often work with young trainees who start their professional careers with very little to no prior tech knowledge. I talk about the social aspects of being a mentor and show process examples that help with long-term motivation. Recorded at the [PerlCon Riga](https://perlcon.eu/talk/127) in 2019.

* [Finding humans to turn into developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b33MDXyl3Mw&t=6150s) &ndash; I explain how to hire the right junior developers or trainees. I explore what qualities and soft skills to look for and how to figure out if someone really wants to be a developer. The methods I talk about have been used successfully in Germany as well as the UK. Recorded at the [Swiss Perl Workshop 2018](http://act.perl-workshop.ch/spw2018/talk/7518).

* [Progressing from humans to developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq6g2OPXlx0) &ndash; Based on my previous talks (above), this details how software developer training might be structured using a progression framework. Recorded at [the German Perl/Raku Workshop 2020](https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2020/talk/7708).

* [Turning humans into developers in a post Covid world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC5uKgsyKkc) &ndash; A full circle approach to hiring, training and progressing junior developers, this talk is a one hour walk-through containing parts of my three previous topics, adjusted to the new reality of mostly working from home.
